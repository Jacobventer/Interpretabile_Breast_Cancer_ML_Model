# Interpretabile_Breast_Cancer_ML_Model
As part of my BSc Data Science in the subject - Model Engineering: Development of an Interpretable Model for Breast Cancer Prediction.

# 🧠 Interpretable Breast Cancer Prediction Model

This repository contains the implementation of a **transparent and interpretable machine learning model** designed to predict whether a breast tumour is **benign (B)** or **malignant (M)** based on diagnostic features from the **UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

The project was completed as part of the **Model Engineering (DLBDSME01)** module for the **BSc Data Science** degree program.

## 🗂️ Project Overview
- **Objective:** Develop an interpretable, high-performing classification model for breast cancer detection.  
- **Goal:** Achieve F1-score ≥ 0.95 and provide feature-level interpretability to support oncologist decision-making.  
- **Methodology:** Follows the **CRISP-DM** process (Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment).
